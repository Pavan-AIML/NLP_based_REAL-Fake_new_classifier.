<h1>Identifying real and fake news using NLP techniques.<h1>

- This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify whether a given news article is real or fake.
- The model will be trained on a dataset containing labeled news articles, with real news articles labeled as "real" and fake news articles labeled as "fake".
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques will be used to extract features from the text of the news articles, which will then be used to train the machine learning model.
- The model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Important point to take care of the numpy version == 1.26.4
- Used NLP libraries are spacy, nltk, gensim.
